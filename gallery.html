          <p>Narrative Story Game created using Twine, displayed on a website of my own creation</p>
          <p><h5><i>In Reality</i></h5></p>
          <p><i>In Reality</i> was my big project that a lot of my work was created for. Originally, there was only one short chapter
          but after I finished the first, I couldn't help myself but to make the second. This game is about a person's journey through
          the afterlife. The main point of the story game is to discover why this person died. There are multiple options, some which leads 
          to dead ends. To find out more, click on the image above to see the official website for this story game.</p>

          <h5><p><i>Halloween Cat</i> (1024 x 768)</p></h5>
          <p><i>
            There resides a peculiar statue of a cat at 
            the abandoned house a bit away from the others. This cat is no ordinary cat as it has two extra tails and horns sticking out of its little witches hat. Though it has a strange look, the mystery of the cat is even stranger. Every year, on Halloween day, the cat disappears without a trace behind, then the day after, the cat is back as if it were never gone in the first place. The oddest occurrences happen Halloween night. The webs that adorn the decorated houses end up on the street, the lamps flicker at an unusual pace, and the children are saddened that their candy mysteriously disappears every year. Where does it end up you may ask? Why, in the pumpkin that forever stands next to that mysterious cat.

          <p>This character is from a game I used to play called <i>Genshin Impact.</i> This composition was created before I stopped playing.
          I used Photoshop to crop the character out of the original image and add text then I used Illustrator to add the shape of the flames.
          I then went back into Photoshop to add a light source from the flames.</p>

            <a href="https://youtu.be/rZrhyPzkvQM" target="_blank">Burnout</a> (1920 x 1080)
            </i></h5></p>
           <p>
            <i>Burnout</i> is my favorite video that I created. It is about how draining it could be to a student and how they struggle
             to stay focused. Students would rather do anything else than pay attention. This is because they are experiencing burnout. Even 
             when the person in the video was trying to study, they couldn't comprehend anything they were reading. Only when this student
             goes outside, away from the draining environment of the library, does the tone of the video change. They feel at peace and as if 
             they were free. I myself was experiencing burnout during the filming of this video, which I hinted to at the end. This video was 
             filmed with my phone and edited together uding Adobe Premiere Pro. I recorded the sounds with Voice Memos then edited it into a cohesive
             soundtrack. <b>Click on the title to see the video!</b>

            </i></h5></p>
          <p>
           First, I filmed multiple clips using my phone. This was before I purchased a professional
            camera but I feel like it adds to the nature of this video. I used Adobe Premiere Pro to 
            edit the clips together as well as add background music. The people in the video are actually 
            my roommates. <b>Click on the title to see the video!</b></p>

          <p><h5><i>
            <a href="https://youtu.be/riUan7bKT1w" target="_blank">Sound 1</a> (1920 x 1080)
            </i></h5></p>
         <p>
           I recorded unique sounds using Voice Memos. I used Adobe Audition to edit the sounds in a a random order. I then recorded clips of one of my roommates
           trying to match the audio track I created. I created a video based on the sound. The last step was to edit the clips
           together in Premiere Pro. Finally, I added the audio track to the video. <b>Click on the title to see the video!</b>

         <p><h5><i>
            <a href="https://youtu.be/AX19kZpwf_g" target="_blank">Unerving</a> (1920 x 1080)
            </i></h5></p>
    
          <p>
            Similarly to <i>Sound 1</i>, I recorded the sounds and created the audio track before I recorded the video. I used the same sounds
            however, I edited them together differently. This audiotrack was almost horror-like. This inspired me to film an unerving and gritty 
            video. <b>Click on the title to see the video!</b>
